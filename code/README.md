# Project Happy Thoughts

A twitter-like feed with posts of happy thoughts. You can read and like other peoples happy thoughts or post your own. 

Built using: React, HTML5, CSS3 (useEffect, useState, form validation, props, API:s) 

## Fulfilled requirements

✓ Your page should follow the design as closely as possible - The feed matches the design but I've added a background image for a personal touch

✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)

✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received

✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts

✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought
