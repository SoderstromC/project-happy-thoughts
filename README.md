# Happy Thoughts

#4 Individual project

Built a twitter like feed of Happy thoughts by fetching and posting data to an API

Tech: React, API, HTML, CSS

Tech focus:

- Your page should follow the design as closely as possible

- You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)

- Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received

- You should have a form to post new thoughts

- You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought
